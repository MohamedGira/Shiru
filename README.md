# Revenge of Shiru: A Game Development Adventure

Welcome to **Shiru**, a thrilling game set in a world haunted by monstrous creatures. In this captivating adventure, you'll follow the loyal dog Shiru on a quest for revenge after the tragic loss of his owner, Jonathan Darrow.

## About the Project

Revenge of Shiru is a game developed using JavaScript modules. As an artist, Jonathan Darrow is slain by terrifying creatures, prompting his faithful dog, Shiru, to start on a journey filled with vengeance and loyalty.

## Learning and Challenges

This project has been an incredible learning adventure. Inspired by a game development video on YouTube, I ventured into crafting a game from scratch. Throughout the process, I encountered challenges that triggered memories of object-oriented programming concepts.

I dived into optimization techniques and design patterns, implementing strategies like object pooling to prevent CPU exhaustion and Singleton for efficient resource utilization. However, the most transformative discovery was the State design pattern. This pattern not only improved the robustness and maintainability of my code but also granted me a new level of control over the game's dynamics.

## Software Principles and Architecture

The project allowed me to re-embrace software principles like interfaces, polymorphism, and inheritance. These concepts resulted in a clean and organized architecture. Creating new enemies, states, and abilities became effortlessly modular, underscoring the power of SOLID and separation of concerns (SoC) principles.

## A Journey of Skill Development

Beyond crafting a game, this project became a journey of self-improvement as a software developer. I witnessed the seamless transition of theoretical concepts into practical applications. The feeling of overcoming challenges with innovative solutions fueled my enthusiasm to continually enhance my skills.

## Try It Out!

I'm excited to present **Shiru** and invite you to experience the thrill firsthand! Stay curious, keep coding, and remember, even a side project can wield immense power in honing your skills. Embark on this adventure and let the games begin! ðŸŽ®
